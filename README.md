# Homework-04

I wanted to recap with a few notes:

Submittal delay: thank you for your patience on this. I appreciate that you allowed me to really spend time on this. I put likely 35 hours into this, which I am not sure is actually a good thing. If there is any critical feedback you have on any part of my code, it will be gratefully received.

Last note I would like to make is on the final charts for Scores by School Spending, Size and type. This I played around with, since the code seemed correct but for some reason it did not want to include Aver Math Score, Aver Reading Score, % Overall Passing columns. I believe how I used "import statistics" at the top has something to do with it.
