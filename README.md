# Python Homework-04

Analysis of district-wide standardized test results including student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Aggregation of the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance:

District Summary
School Summary
Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)
Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)
Math Scores by Grade
Reading Scores by Grade
Scores by School Spending
Scores by School Size
Scores by School Type


Notes:
Bugs with final charts for "Scores by School Spending, Size and type". This I played around with, since the code seemed correct but for some reason it did not want to include Aver Math Score, Aver Reading Score, % Overall Passing columns. I believe how I used "import statistics" at the top has something to do with it.
